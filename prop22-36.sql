Due to this, Wallich Residence would undeniably become a home that elevates the lifestyle of any individual.\n\n\nWallich Residence is made up of 181 exclusive units of luxury apartments and is the residential segment of the multi-use development, Tanjong Pagar Centre. A number of components such as grade A offices, a 5-star business hotel, a retail podium and an urban park are all consolidated within this 5-in-1 vertical city.\n\nWithin the building, residences span from the 39th to the 64th floors. The four levels of in-house common areas are the Main Lobby (Level 1), Social 180 (Level 39), Cloud 220 (Level 52) and Apex (Level 62), which house exclusive and luxurious facilities, the epitome of sumptuous living. Other than that, the high-speed lifts and 567 car park lots are other necessary facilities that are there to make residents’ lives that much simpler.\n\nSome essential amenities around the area are also worth exploring as Tanjong Pagar is truly a district that is undergoing rapid and massive changes with the development of the greater southern waterfront.\n                                    Read More\n                            ','\n            \n                Air-Conditioning,Balcony,Bombshelter,City View,Cooker Hob/Hood,Corner Unit,Dining Room Furniture,Dryer,Fridge,High Floor,Intercom,Maidsroom,Oven / Microwave,Renovated,Washing Machine,Water Heater\n                \n            \n            ','https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/listing/21924401/for-sale-wallich-residence','Wallich Residence, 3 Wallich Street, 3 Bedrooms, 1755 sqft, Condos & Apartments for sale, by Gina Tng, S$ 5,190,000, 21924401','','\n                        Gina Tng\n                        \n                    ','ERA REALTY NETWORK PTE LTD'),

The SOHO and condo units benefit from views of the sea and/or the surrounding parks. The triplex townhouses resemble villas, and afford residents direct access to the swimming pool. Due to the developer purchasing the land prior to new legislation, foreigners are able to purchase the townhouse units at SeaHill without LDAU approval, something they are no longer normally allowed to do.\n                                    Read More\n                            ','\n            \n                Air-Conditioning,Balcony,Cooker Hob/Hood,Park / Greenery View,High Floor,Water Heater\n                \n            \n            ','https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/listing/23896718/for-sale-seahill','Seahill, 119 West Coast Crescent, 3 Bedrooms, 1044 sqft, Condos & Apartments for sale, by Chua Jocelyn, S$ 1,750,000, 23896718','','\n                        Chua Jocelyn\n                        \n                    ','CLS PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SERVICES'),

The Levelz offers freehold tenure to its tenants. One of the greatest advantage that the residents of The Levelz can make use of is its extremely high accessibility. There is a lot of bus stops surrounding the development and there are two MRT stations that are within close proximity of the development as well. Furthermore, The Levelz is suitable for a growing family to live in because it is located close to a number of schools in the area.The Levelz development project was completed quite recently in the year of 2000 and it was developed by CapitaLand Residential. CapitaLand Residential is one of Asia’s largest diversified real estate groups and they are headquartered and listed in Singapore.\n                                    Read More\n                            ','\n            \n                Air-Conditioning,Balcony,Cooker Hob/Hood,Corner Unit,Park / Greenery View,High Floor,Intercom,Renovated,Water Heater\n                \n            \n            ','https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/listing/24069557/for-sale-the-levelz','The Levelz, 38 Farrer Road, 1 Bedroom, 807 sqft, Condos & Apartments for sale, by Ros Salleh, S$ 1,688,888, 24069557','','\n                        Ros Salleh\n                        \n                    ','PROPNEX REALTY PTE.

At Amber Park, 2 distinct recreation zones let you take full advantage of the coastal location. Play amidst the clouds up at The Stratosphere overlooking the sea, or make a splash at the Lagoon Bay. At the end of the day, retreat to your inner sanctum, resting easy on the assurance of quality and luxury.\n\nThe Stratosphere, the rooftop decoration deck is the signature feature of Amber Park. Rising 235 feet above sea level, The Stratosphere lets nothing come between the sky, sea and you. Catch the dawn from the Yoga Deck, and watch the rays lingering from the Lounge at the other end.\n\nAmber Park finds itself just a 3 minutes drive away from the East Coast Parkway, while the Marina Coastal Expressway and Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway are 8 and 9 minutes drives, respectfully\n\nFacilities: Full Condo Facilities\n\nDON\'T HESITATE:\n==============\n  Enjoy Developer Attractive Prices\n  VVIP OWNERSHIP / Best Price Guaranteed / Tailored to ALL YOUR REQUIREMENTS!\n\n\nFOR ATTRACTIVE PRICE & CHOICE UNITS, CALL Hotline Ros :  (+65) 91384388(+65) 91384388 \n\n\n(首选单位，优惠价格，考查发展项目，请拨热线 Ros : (+65) 91384388(+65) 91384388 \n\n                                    Read More\n                            ','\n            \n                Air-Conditioning,Balcony\n                \n            \n            ','https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/listing/24263601/for-sale-amber-park','Amber Park, 18 Amber Gardens, 5 Bedrooms, 2045 sqft, Condos & Apartments for sale, by Ros Salleh, S$ 5,064,388, 24263601','Condominium','\n                        Ros Salleh\n                        \n                    ','PROPNEX REALTY PTE.

Opposite a large Park comprising a playground, soon-to-be cafe and even a dog and basketball court. But the house! Breezy and cool, with a long frontage and a rear garden. 2 storeys which can be three, 4 beds which can be extended to your liking. Capture the feel of yesteryear. Its grace and old fashioned concrete vents. Its timber floors and 4 meter high walls with rafters.

Larger-sized units saw more interest from homeowners recently.\n\nNestled within a predominately landed, low-rise private housing estate, The Gazania’s seven 5-storey blocks offer enchanting views of a lush landscaped terrain interlacing within generous facilities and amenities. Localised sunken courtyards are designed to bring in daylight and greeneries to the basement level where the mezzanine units are located. The mezzanines’ balconies are opened to sky within these courtyards to create continuity of landscape from the e-deck to basement. Extensive use of glass and wide balconies on all the units’ facades allow residents to enjoy expansive views from within their homes. A palette of earth tone colours and materials chosen for the clean-line facades creates an elegant yet homely feel to the whole development.\n                                    Read More\n                            ','\n            \n                Air-Conditioning,Balcony,Cooker Hob/Hood,Fridge,Park / Greenery View,Oven / Microwave,Renovated,Washing Machine\n                \n            \n            ','https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/listing/23857787/for-sale-the-gazania','The Gazania, 5 How Sun Drive, 4 Bedrooms, 1744 sqft, Condos & Apartments for sale, by Renee Yap, S$ 3,240,000, 23857787','Condominium','\n                        Renee Yap\n                        \n                    ','ERA REALTY NETWORK PTE LTD'),
